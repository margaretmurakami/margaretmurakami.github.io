Naomi Klein’s 2014 book, This Changes Everything, draws a connection between high emissions and corporate capitalism. In her view, the only way to reduce emissions and avoid climate catastrophe is to overhaul our current economic system. Rather than blaming any individual or industry, Klein underlines the root cause of climate change as the political and economic systems that have given rise to unchecked emissions. To solve the climate crisis, we need mass social movements aided by widespread political reform. Specifically, by deconstructing ideologies of deregulation, privatization, and the elevation of free-market capitalism, we can bring about social equity and help prevent further environmental damage.

At best, Klein’s book is brave and creative: she fearlessly outlines the ways by which corporate elites’ pursuit of profit has propelled us into a warmer climate. She correctly describes the Obama administration as a missed opportunity to tackle climate change. Her contention that most climate action to this point has been indecisive—primarily due to the decisions of profit-driven corporate elites—is also well-argued.

At worst, the author falls short of presenting a tangible solution to the climate crisis. In her conclusion, she champions grassroots social movements aided by a 21st century Green New Deal. However, I found this argument abbreviated and a bit hand-waving as compared with previous takedowns of economic elites. Similarly, she oversimplifies then dismisses some other solutions to climate change such as geoengineering.

Finally, Klein frequently characterizes climate change as at odds with capitalism; I don’t think this is entirely correct. Climate change is a consequence of rapid human development aided by fossil fuels. Whether we like it or not, the industrial development we’ve come to appreciate has been paid for by emissions; the swift transition away from this dependency as Klein proposes is rather unrealistic. Instead, I think we should invest in all possible opportunities, focusing on growth in all sectors, particularly in green energy. Rather than writing off geoengineering as a pipe dream as the author does, we should fund research in this field to better understand its possible implications.
