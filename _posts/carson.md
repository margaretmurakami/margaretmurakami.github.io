Over sixty years later, Rachel Carson’s <em>Silent Spring</em> remains germane. Known as one of the most impactful books in the field of environmental protection, <em>Silent Spring</em>’s discussion of the risks of widespread pesticide use is cited as key in the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency and the banning of DDT.

Carson was a marine biologist by training, who earned her Master’s degree from Johns Hopkins in 1932. While pursuing a doctorate during the Great Depression, Carson felt compelled to leave the university to work and support her family; she never completed her PhD. Over the next twenty years, she wrote several essays as well as the bestselling book The Sea Around Us. After two decades of research, she published <em>Silent Spring</em> in 1962 and died of cancer two years later.

The book amalgamates case studies—both reported and observed by Carson—highlighting the risks pesticides pose to plants, animals, and humans. Carson’s thesis is that everything in the world is interconnected and that humans are a component of this dynamic system. Furthermore, people cannot perform localized treatments of heavy chemical pesticides without seeing serious downstream effects. She concludes with an important question: is it worth living in a world where all the natural beauty has died?

Upon its publication, <em>Silent Spring</em> faced backlash from the chemical lobby, who sought to deny, discredit, and spread misinformation about Carson and her findings. Despite this, public outcry over pesticide use led to the eventual ban of DDT in the US in 1972.

Even for casual observers of nature, this book is a delightful read. Carson’s writing is witty and full of life. With each turn of phrase, she draws the reader in. Her damnation of the chemical lobby is assertive, yet the way in which she describes flora and fauna of American suburbia is masterful. In a short text, she captures human fascination with nature in a way that is rare among environmental literature.

With my cynical tendencies, this book was an important reminder that progress is possible, and that environmental triumphs can and have been achieved. Carson’s book is also proof that the work of one person can effect massive reform for environmental protection. More personally, there has also been so much progress for women in STEM since the author’s time in academia. Today, Carson would likely have been supported in a PhD program; this fact reminds me just how far we’ve come in the past sixty years. This is not to mention her rumored relationship with Dorothy Freeman. I cannot express my gratitude enough for our foremothers in science like Rachel Carson; students like myself stand on the backs of these giants.

The legacy of <em>Silent Spring</em> is well-deserved. This book is an important read for environmental scientists and nature-lovers alike. Now and in the decades to come, we all could benefit from a reminder of the interconnectedness of our planet.
