### Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of Texas at Austin.

### About me

More specifically, I work with <a href="https://heimbach.wordpress.com/">Patrick Heimbach</a> in the <a href="https://crios-ut.github.io/">Computational Research in Ice and Ocean Systems group</a> (CRIOS). While my background is more in geophysics, the CRIOS group is based at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. My current research focus is on studying water mass transformations in the North Atlantic using the MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm) as a member of the NASA-funded Estimating the Circulation of the Climate and Ocean (ECCO) consortium.<br><br>
Before starting as a UT graduate student in 2023, I earned my M.Sc. in hydrosphere geophysics at Helsinki University working with Petteri Uotila and <a href="https://aleksinummelin.github.io/">Aleksi Nummelin</a>. My thesis, <a href="Water Mass Transformations Within Prydz Bay Coastal Polynyas from Clustered Drifters">Water Mass Transformations Within Prydz Bay Coastal Polynyas from Clustered Drifters</a> used a regional ocean model to study Southern Ocean overturning and associated water mass transformations in East Antarctica.<br><br>
Before this still, I graduated with a B.Sc. in Geology at the University of Texas at Austin. My undergraduate research was with <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/sb/">Sahar Bakhshian</a> on modeling porous-scale fluid flow.<br><br>Outside of work, I try to spend time with my two pet rabbits, and enjoy dancing and studying linguistics.
