### Welcome!

Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations.

### About me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of Texas at Austin. More specifically, I work with <a href="https://heimbach.wordpress.com/">Patrick Heimbach</a> in the <a href="https://crios-ut.github.io/">Computational Research in Ice and Ocean Systems group</a> (CRIOS). While my background is more in geophysics, the CRIOS group is based at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. My current research focus is on studying water mass transformations in the North Atlantic using the MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm) as a member of the NASA-funded Estimating the Circulation of the Climate and Ocean (ECCO) consortium.<br><br>
Before starting as a UT graduate student in 2023, I earned my M.Sc. in hydrosphere geophysics at Helsinki University working with Petteri Uotila and <a href="https://aleksinummelin.github.io/">Aleksi Nummelin</a>. My thesis, <a href="Water Mass Transformations Within Prydz Bay Coastal Polynyas from Clustered Drifters">Water Mass Transformations Within Prydz Bay Coastal Polynyas from Clustered Drifters</a> used a regional ocean model to study Southern Ocean overturning and associated water mass transformations in East Antarctica.<br><br>
Before this still, I graduated with a B.Sc. in Geology at the University of Texas at Austin. My undergraduate research was with <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/sb/">Sahar Bakhshian</a> on modeling porous-scale fluid flow.<br><br>Outside of work, I try to spend time with my two pet rabbits, and enjoy dancing and studying linguistics.
